# NASMon

Arduino-powered system monitor with a Python backend.  Simply provide a set of 'pages', (files containing commands
and )

## Getting Started (TODO)

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites (TODO)

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Hardware (TODO)

The NASMon hardware is made completely out of off-the-shelf items:
* [Arduino Nano] - Microcontroller
* [Adafruit Bi-Color 24-Bar LED Bargraph] - (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1721) i2c led bargraph controlled by a MAX7219
* [128 x 32 OLED] - i2c OLED display
* [IR proximity sensor]

### Installing (TODO)

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Built With (TODO)

* [PacketSerial](https://github.com/bakercp/PacketSerial) - Arduino packet communication library
